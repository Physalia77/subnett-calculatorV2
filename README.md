# Subnet Calculator

This project is a Subnet Calculator built with Python and Tkinter. It provides a graphical user interface to input an IP address and subnet mask, and it calculates various details about the subnet.

## Features

- Calculate IP in binary format
- Validate IP address
- Convert subnet mask to decimal and binary
- Calculate number of hosts and usable hosts
- Calculate subnet ID
- Calculate broadcast IP
- Calculate first and last available IP in the subnet
- Determine IP class (A, B, C, D, E)
- Determine if the IP is private or public

## Files

- `main.py`: This is the main file that runs the application. It sets up the GUI and handles the events.
- `functions.py`: This file contains all the functions used to calculate the IP address details.
